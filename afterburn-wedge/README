[ Licensing ]

All code incorporated into this project must be distributable under the 
BSD license.  Do not copy code from GPL projects.  Code
licensed under the GPL is prohibited in this project.

If GPL code becomes necessary, then put it in a separate 'contrib' directory, 
where it will be easily identified as contaminated.


[ Architecture ]

Note that much of this code is temporary infrastructure for booting
the project.  It is the intention to improve the code with maturity, 
especially modularity, error handling, performance, completeness, and
correctness.


[ libc ]

POSIX and libc are antiquated interfaces, with many aspects dangerous for code
quality.  This project purposely avoids them, except when running on POSIX
systems.

Try to avoid introducing printf() into this project.  Use operator overloading.
It is safe, simple to implement, and extensible (thus permitting nice output
mechanisms for complex types).


[ ELF ]

The ELF format is flexible.  For the L4 wedge, we use ELF features to allocate
non-conflicting regions of the virtual address space for immediate access to
the KIP, UTCB area, and data structures shared with the resource monitor.

Additionally, we use ELF sections to help achieve an architecture-neutral
initialization path, avoiding assembler.  We protect the startup stack
from being cleared during initialization.  We init the C++ static
constructors manually.  Please maintain the spirit of these simple solutions.


[ Build Infrastructure ]

Please do not incorporate autoconf and configure scripts.
